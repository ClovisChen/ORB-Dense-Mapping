# ORB-Dense-Mapping

# What are modified:

* changing the vocabulary loading method into binary mod

* adding a pointcloud viewer( realized by adding a viewer thread )

* changing the CMakeLists.txt that all the executable files are placed in ./bin

## depth fuse
* depth prediction for every left image
* in every keyframe, fuse the geometry depth (generated by triangulation) and learning depth (generated by FCN network) with linear model
* optimize the linear model

## mono-depth
* [mono-depth](https://github.com/ClovisChen/LearningCNN) ./fusion_net
* plaing it to '/home/chen-tian/data/KITTI/odom_gray/dataset/sequences/04'
* refer to [monodepth](https://github.com/mrharicot/monodepth)

## DEGAN
* modified FCN network to GAN network
* [tensorlayer structure] (https://github.com/tensorlayer/srgan)
